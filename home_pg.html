				<img src="narkey.png" alt="Wakaboomee Faculty" />
			<blockquote>
				Since I was a child, I’ve had a passion for helping people.  
				But for much of my life, helping people was limited and expressed rather perfunctorily.  
				It was only when I wrote a children’s book and volunteered to read it weekly to various groups 
				of students at a Title-1 elementary school that I realized how much a green little creature named Wakaboomee 
				had the ability to impact the lives of children.  Together with Wakaboomee and a group of incredible individuals 
				who have a real passion for change.
