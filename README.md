A WIP Website 

Page Documentation and Layout Explanation

In order to not waste your time trying to make it look like more was done, I will only put down actions I took once.  So if I used the same or a similar concept on another page I wont place it on the word doc repeatedly.

Lets start with the homepage:	
•	Used meta tags and link tags to connect pages and images I wanted to use within my site.
•	Used a horizontal navigation list in all of my pages. 
•	 Used the basic formatting as well as different tags that are used in basic writing such as h1, section, header, footer, ect.
•	Used a character encoding reference in the footer for the circle character.
•	created several stylesheets with a focus on making the site cohesive with a simple pastel color pattern.
•	Adjusted the way the font for all tags under their perspective sections looked.
•	Added  a shadow background behind the main wallpaper to add contrast because the body color is close to one of the background colors
•	Created a promo video from scratch using canva and put it on the site.
```dif
•	Still working on image map!
```
•	Created an overall layout using div tags
•	Made it so anything larger than 640px would split single columns into two columns using Flex Wrap

Sessions Page:
o	Added a video using YouTube
o	Added a descriptive list for each activity
o	Added a basic calendar that goes over school schedule
o	Used a separate CSS sheet to add a non-colored print page

Donate Page:
o	Added links to telephone and email
```dif
•	Attempted a webform before rage quitting in a hail of fury after struggling for several days. Honestly Ive added and then deleted so much from this section alone its unreal. So WIP still Haha.
